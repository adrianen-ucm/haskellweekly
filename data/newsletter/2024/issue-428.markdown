Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Announcing opt-env-conf](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2024-07-08_announcing-opt-env-conf) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > This post announces `opt-env-conf`, a new settings parsing library for Haskell. This library combines the best of `optparse-applicative`, `envparse`, and `autodocodec`, together with the colours from `safe-coloured-text` to provide all your apps' runtime settings.

- [Building a data compression utility in Haskell using Huffman codes](https://lazamar.github.io/haskell-data-compression-with-huffman-codes/) by Marcelo Lazaroni
  > In this post we will implement a data compression program in about 150 lines of Haskell. It will use Huffman coding and handle arbitrary binary files using constant memory for encoding and decoding.
  
- [Collatz Computations in Base 2 and 3](https://cdsmithus.medium.com/collatz-computations-in-base-2-and-3-af04976d7826) by Chris Smith
  > Every so often, the Collatz conjecture comes up in discussion forums I read, and I start to think about it again. I did for a bit this past weekend. Here are my thoughts this time around.
  
- [Haskell For Dilettantes - Part 1 - Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlTJU8wLo7E) by Tea Leaves
  > My plan is to start a series of these videos where I introduce some aspect of the Haskell language and then explain it to you, probably very badly. Think of it as Baby’s First Haskell. And I wanted to call out the fact that although I am a programmer by trade, I don’t write Haskell professionally. You’re getting my dilettante’s opinions of the language. Hopefully you can find some value in that perspective.
  
- [Multi Component Support in HLS with cabal-install 3.12](https://well-typed.com/blog/2024/07/hls-multi/) by Zubin Duggal
  > Over the last few years we have been working on implementing support for multiple components (sometimes referred to as multiple home units) across various parts of the ecosystem. This is a feature which allows you to load multiple components, which may depend on each other, into a single GHC session. For instance, you can load both a library and a testsuite into a single GHCi session, and `:reload` commands will pick up changes across both components. In this post we will discuss how you can take advantage of this support in the Haskell Language Server. 

- [Servant on AWS Lambda, and Two New Libraries](https://exploring-better-ways.bellroy.com/servant-on-aws-lambda-and-two-new-libraries.html) by Jack Kelly
  > In a previous post, I mentioned that we run most of our Haskell code on AWS Lambda. Today, I want to look inside those binaries, discuss the libraries we use to do “serverless” web services on AWS, and highlight a few new libraries we’ve recently open sourced.
