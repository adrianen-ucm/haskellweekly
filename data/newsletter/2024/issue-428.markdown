Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Servant on AWS Lambda, and Two New Libraries](https://exploring-better-ways.bellroy.com/servant-on-aws-lambda-and-two-new-libraries.html) by Jack Kelly
  > In a previous post, I mentioned that we run most of our Haskell code on AWS Lambda. Today, I want to look inside those binaries, discuss the libraries we use to do “serverless” web services on AWS, and highlight a few new libraries we’ve recently open sourced.
